# Future Work
As this tool is a work in progress, some features are missing. The details of which are laid out below.

If you have any feature requests, please create a new [issue](https://github.com/daraghhollman/JUPT/issues) on the github page with as much detail as you can.

## JADE

### Electrons
JADE electrons data are mostly implimented. Pitch angle plots are only currently available in units of differential energy flux.

We intend to implement pitch angle plots in units of a distribution function, as this is what is often plotted in publications.

### Moments
JADE moments are a recent addition to the PDS and are a moderate priority for the tool. There are issues with major data gaps in the data and its current usability for early years of the Juno mission should be questioned.

JADE moments are a minor priority for the tool.

## JEDI
JEDI data are currently not implemented in any way and is a major priority for the tool.
