# Contributing to JUPT

In being an open source project, this tool is open to be worked on by anyone in any way they see fit. We want to make contriuting to this project as easy as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting a bug
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features

## Github
We use github to host the tool, to track issues and feature requests, as well as to manage pull requests.

All code changes happen through pull requests. They are the best way to propose changes to the tool.

Our Github page is found at the following link: [github](https://github.com/daraghhollman/JUPT)
